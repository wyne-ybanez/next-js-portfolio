# Basic Next.js Portfolio Website For Devs

This is a different design of an already popular portfolio template. If you prefer the original that this is based off - you can check it out here: [Simple Portfolio Website](https://simple-developer-portfolio-website.vercel.app/).

1. Detailed blog on this portfolio is on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-portfolio-site-with-nextjs-tailwindcss/), describing and explaining how this site was built from the ground up.

2. Included `constants` folder, where you can directly add your details and it'll get reflected throughout the application. No more customizations for the template required unless desired, just add your data and it'll reflect immediately.

The proftolio template is a simple and minimalistic website to showcase your skills and projects as a developer. The design is inspired by [Kevin Clark](https://kevinclark.ca).

## About Project

My current portfolio still looks like this, minus the odd few tweaks here and there. This was the portfolio site template I have been using for years. It's time for me to pass it on. 
I am no longer maintaining this React project.

You should have no problem with this if you know HTML, JSX, Tailwind. Even better if you know basic React. It really doesn't get more complicated than that.

## Features
